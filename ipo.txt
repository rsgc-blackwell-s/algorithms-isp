ALGORITHM, Odds!

Summary:
A simple iPhone game that requires little to no skill on the user’s end. The game would use simple code that I have already learned from the TipCalculator tutorial from earlier in the course.

Idea: A game that uses the concepts of a markov-chain/bot to create an ‘odds’ type game. This game would simulate the idea of ‘flipping a coin’, with the user choosing the odds of the coin landing on a pre-determined side. The lower the chosen odds, the more points they will gain.

Algorithm: 
 - @IBOutlet(s)
   - labels/counters
 - Variables (var or let)
   - percent
   - score
 - @IBAction(s)
   - slider (maybe textbox…)
   - button (pressed when user wants to check results)
     - random value determined to decide what side coin ‘lands’ on
     - ‘if’ statement (one for each outcome) determines result and displays it to user
     - score reset if coin flips to ‘bad’ side
